# Succulent
> ðŸŒ¿ Lua functions and utilities specifically for Hilbish.

Succulent is a small and simple pure Lua library which adds extra useful functions
to the standard library. Succulent is made for [Hilbish](https://github.com/Rosettea/Hilbish) specifically.

# Usage
If on Hilbish, Succulent should already be added globally. If not, simply `require` it
and all functions will be added.
